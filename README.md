CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It controls layout, colors, fonts, and overall design. CSS3 is the latest evolution, introducing new features like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions, and animations. It enhances design capabilities and improves performance. CSS3 modules allow developers to adopt features progressively, making web design more dynamic and interactive while maintaining compatibility with older CSS standards.
